A number is said to be a mersenne prime if it can be reduced to the formula M = 2^n - 1 where  n is a prime number
The highest mersenne prime number that my program can generate is 2,305,843,009,213,693,951. 
More mersenne primes could have been generated by this program but one of the limiting factors is the data type 
used to store the mersenne prime.
I used the datatype long /Int64 which has a maximum value of 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 and is the largest integer datatype in 
c# that i could use.
